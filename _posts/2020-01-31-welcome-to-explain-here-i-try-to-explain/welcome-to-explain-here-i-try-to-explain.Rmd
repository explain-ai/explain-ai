I first started out writing, on my blog (https://ramith.fyi) back in 2018. I shared articles from electronics to signal processing.
I dedicate this space to share my experience in learning Machine Learning concepts.

Specifically I'll be explaning certain topics on the book Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville^[Goodfellow-et-al-2016 https://www.deeplearningbook.org] as I make progress in that book
